The cost of a stock on each day is given in an array, find the max profit that you can make by buying and selling in those days (buy and sell one time). For example, if the given array is {180, 260, 310, 40, 535, 695}, the max profit can be earned by buying on day 4 and selling on day 6. Obviously you cannot sell before/on the buying day.
